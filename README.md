# 😄 **Emotion Recognizer**  

This project is a **deep learning-based** system that recognizes emotions from facial expressions in images or videos. The goal is to accurately classify emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, surprise, and neutral**, which can be useful for a variety of applications, including healthcare, marketing, and human-computer interaction.

---

## 📖 Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Detects emotions like happy, sad, angry, surprised, and neutral.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Can predict emotions from webcam images or uploaded images.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Uses a deep learning model trained on the **FER-2013 dataset**.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for easy web deployment.

---
